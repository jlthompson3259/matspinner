# Mat Spinner
## Overview
This project's goal is to create a web service for running an ongoing raffle system wherein, for each particiant, successive losses increase the chance of winning. This was designed to be used specifically for running the playmat raffle for *Flesh and Blood* armories so that it better distributes playmats among players.

## How to Run
The whole system can be started by running:
```
docker compose up -d
```

This should build and start all the services automatically.
